web scrape for messageboard idea

to run:

python3 fb.py    

see secrets.example for saving screen name and password.  (make a new 'secrets' folder using that as template)

also you'll probably have to change this line to give it a group that you're in (to scrape its messages)

the code doesn't do very much at the moment.  maybe just log in and go to page, and scrape some user names for the top post
